<!-- This morning I saw the following pen on Satwik Singh's profile: https://codepen.io/Satwik123/pen/jOMBggv I really liked how such a simple game was so much fun.

I thought it would be more fun if I put Goku instead of an intergalactic ship, so I took on the task of redesigning the images and here is the result.

If you dare to play it, let me know how much your record was. Mine was 269. I finished with my finger tired from biting the mouse so much.

One question: instead of Moro, what other character would you choose?
